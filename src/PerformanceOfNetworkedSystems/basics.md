# Basics of Communication Networks

* End-to-end performance measurements
* Business relevance for high performant networks
* Page load times
* Circuit switching - Once a set path is set, all packets of the message are routed through the same path
* Packet switching - packets are sent out over different paths, received and correctly ordered at dest
* Statistical Time Division Multiplexing - "best-effort" approach
* Application view - point to point communicaiton
* Bandwidth - theoretical maximum data transmission rate
* Throughput - bandwidth achieved in practice
* latency - signal propogation delay + queueing
* transmission time - msg size / bandwidth
* Payload Sizes:
    * Large payloads - bandwidth bound (elephants)
    * Small payloads - delay bound (mice)
* Bandwidth Delay Product - product of data link's capacity (bits/second) * RTT
* Maximum throughput of a TCP connection - max window size / RTT
* Optimizing bandwidth
    * data compression
    * send less data
    * caching
* Last Mile latency
* Human Perception of delay - E model standardized Mean opinion scores
* latency is issue for websites


* Probability Distribution
    * Continuous random variables
    * Discrete random vriables
* Uniform Distribution
* Exponential Distribution
    * Probability Density Function (PDF)
    * Cumulative Density Function
* Poisson Distribution
* Poission Process
    * Superposition propoerty (additive)
    * thinning-out propoerty (removal)
* Equilibrium distributions
* Planning Problem
* continuous time markov chain
* Erlang B model
